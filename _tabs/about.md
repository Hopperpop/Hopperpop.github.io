Greetings, I'm Bram (a.k.a Hopperpop), and live and work in Belgium. I have a passion for automating things, which started during my teenage years and has never left me. My professional background includes working in the automotive industry, where I specialized in controlling dynamic test benches. Currently, I'm active in the field of industrial machine building.

Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and showcase the side projects I've developed over the years. Join me as I explore the exciting world of automation, share my experiences and insights, and inspire others to pursue their passion for automation.

If you want to get into contact, send me a mail at <Hopperpop.git@gmail.com>.
